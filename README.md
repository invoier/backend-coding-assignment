# Monthly Exposure

The goal of this task is to process a stream of events and produce a monthly
report. The format of the report is not important, but it should contain what
the _maximum exposure_ was for each calendar month since the beginning of 2022.
We define _exposure_ as the total invoiced amount that is owed our customers.

The input file `events.txt` contains `JSON` formatted events generated by some factoring
system. There are three types of events that we care about:
`InvoiceRegistered`, `LateFeeRegistered` and finally `PaymentRegistered`. All
events have a timestamp and you will find that the events were saved to the file
in the order that they were generated.

Let's look at what each event means and how they affect the exposure.

- `InvoiceRegistered`: A new invoice was created by our customer. The total
  exposure goes up by the invoice amount.
- `LateFeeRegistered`: Sometimes invoices are not paid in time and the system
  then responds by adding a late fee, further increasing the exposure.
- `PaymentRegistered`: Whenever full payment is received the exposure is
  reduced by the outstanding amount.

Given this dataset we want to know, for each calendar month what the peek
exposure was.
